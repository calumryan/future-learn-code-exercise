# Front End Developer Exercise for Future Learn

*Matthew Bee (matt@todayishould.com)*

Instructions moved to INSTRUCTIONS.md and README.md has become developer instructions for running the code test locally and notes on development. 

## Installation

### Requirements
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [bower](https://bower.io/)

### Installation

Clone this repo.  Navigate to the repository folder if required.

Run ```npm install``` - This will install gulp, gulp sass, gulp source maps and browser-sync. Mostly development dependencies.

Run ```bower install``` - This will install all front end dependencies (jQuery). 

jQuery is purely used for speed - as I only have a limited time to develop code for the test - it's been used to allow more work to be completed. Everything could easily be done in vanilla JS, but would take more testing time.
