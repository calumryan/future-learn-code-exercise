Front-end Developer Exercise
============================

This is the front-end exercise we ask all front-end candidates to work on before being invited in for a technical interview.

Please try to do as much of it as you can in two hours. Please don't take more than two hours - the aim is not to complete some production-ready finished software, but just to see some code that you've written that will give us a starting point for discussion in the interview. Being able to tell us about the code that you would have written next is just as interesting as what you submit.

We're interested in your technical choices and judgements, reasoning and ability to understand and explain the trade-offs behind them.

We would like to see markup and CSS that you've written though - so if you want to use it, jQuery is ok, but Bootstrap is not.

The user story for this exercise is:

As a Learner,
I'd like to view user menu options available to me, accessible from my avatar,
So that I can navigate around the site.

The user avatar that the menu should be accessible from is the initialled coloured square behind the menu in the visual - the avatar doesn't exist yet and so also needs to be built as part of this story.

The visual file `user-options-menu.png` shows what the avatar & menu should look like when this module is finished.
The file `full-screen-for-context` shows the menu in the context of the page when it's activated - please note though that only the avatar and menu need to be built, this visual is just included to give you a sense of where the module should fit on the page.

We've also included the icons, and you can use the pattern library [Futurelearn colour reference](https://www.futurelearn.com/pattern-library/core-patterns#colours) to get the hex values.

This exercise should look as much like the design as possible in browsers listed in our [Browser Support matrix](https://about.futurelearn.com/browser-support/). For other browsers, the content and functionality should be available.

To submit your exercise, you can either send us a link to a Git repo, or archive your repo (ideally including the Git history).

*PLEASE NOTE: clone this repo, don't fork it or submit a PR, as it's a public repository.*

In either case, please send the info to [jobs@futurelearn.com](mailto:jobs@futurelearn.com). Thankyou!
